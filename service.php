              Dermatologists also understand that a skin condition can have a serious impact on your health and
              well-being.
              Sometimes, a skin condition is a sign of a serious underlying health issue, and your dermatologist may be
              the
              first one to notice it. For example, signs of diabetes and heart disease can show up on the skin.
              Your dermatologist knows that a skin condition doesn’t have to be life-threatening to reduce a person’s
              quality
              of life. A skin condition can cause sleep loss, poor self-image, serious depression, or lost productivity.
              Eczema (aka atopic dermatitis), hair loss that causes scarring, and psoriasis are some conditions that can
              do this.
              The dermatopathologist examines tissue removed during a skin biopsy with a microscope and provides your
              dermatologist
              with a written report called a biopsy report or pathology report. This report will tell if you have a
              disease, and if so,
              what it is. If a disease is found, it will include other information that can help determine the best
              possible treatment.

              A pathologist is a medical healthcare provider who examines bodies and body tissues. He or she is
              also responsible for performing lab tests. A pathologist helps other healthcare providers reach diagnoses
              and is an important member of the treatment team. Pathologists have completed medical school and must have
              at least 3 years of advanced medical education in a residency training program to be eligible to take
              board
              certification exams. Pathologists are board-certified through the American Board of Pathology. Most
              pathologists
              receive training in both clinical and anatomical pathology. Pathologists may practice in all areas of
              pathology
              Pathologists practice in community, university, and government hospitals and clinics, as well as in
              independent

              Respiratory Medicine is an extremely rewarding career choice for any junior doctor seeking a future in
              frontline
              medicine. The prospective trainee can look forward to experience in a broad and constantly evolving field
              of medicine
              closely linked to many other specialities. Hence a chest Physician is the embodiment of a team player;
              linking with oncology,
              radiology, intensive care, cardiology and the emergency medicine departments. Current developments in
              Ambulatory and Community
              linked services dovetail a service with a strong history of chronic disease management. Chronic
              Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,
              Asthma and Lung Cancer represent a sizeable component of the Respiratory Team workload. However more than
              30% of a General Medical
              acute Take-in has a primary respiratory diagnosis. Lung infections, Tuberculosis, Cystic Fibrosis &
              Bronchiectasis are another significant
              cohort of patients requiring multiprofessional training and a specialized skillset.

              A neurologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the nervous system. The nervous
              system is made of two parts: the central and peripheral nervous system. It includes the brain and spinal
              cord.
              Illnesses, disorders, and injuries that involve the nervous system often require a neurologist’s
              management and
              treatment. Neurologists manage and treat neurological conditions, or problems with the nervous
              system.People who
              are having problems with their senses, such as touch, vision, or smell, may also need to see a
              neurologist.
              Problems with senses are sometimes caused by nervous system disorders. Because the nervous system is
              complex,
              a neurologist may specialize in a specific area. They’ll do a fellowship in that area after residency
              training.
              Subspecialties have evolved to narrow a doctor’s focus.

              Cancer surgery is an operation or procedure to take out a tumor and possibly some nearby tissue.
              It is the oldest kind of cancer treatment, and it still works well to treat many types of cancer today.
              A doctor who specializes in cancer surgery is called a "surgical oncologist".Surgery can be performed in
              a doctor's office, clinic, surgery center, or hospital. Where you go depends on the type of surgery and
              how much time you need to heal. Your surgery may require medication to block the awareness of pain, called
              anesthesia.
              There are different types of anesthesia depending on the type and extent of the surgery.If you need to
              stay in the
              hospital overnight or for several days after surgery, it is called inpatient surgery. Or you might not
              need to stay
              in the hospital at all. If you can go home the same day, it is called outpatient surgery or ambulatory
              surgery.

              Spine surgeons are doctors who specialize in the treatment of conditions that affect the spine.
              Both orthopedic Surgeons and Neurosurgeons are trained in and may specialize in spinal procedures.
              In some cases, specialization training may be involve a combined team of both orthopedic and
              neurosurgeons.
              Spine surgeons are medical doctors, meaning they have an M.D. or a D.O. Both degree titles require the
              same
              certifications and post-medical school training to specialize in spine surgery.After completing medical
              school,
              doctors who aim to become spine surgeons must graduate from an approved residency program. Doctors who
              have
              specialized in orthopedic Surgery or Neurological Surgery may subspecialize in spinal surgery. After
              completing
              their residencies, doctors must then spend a year or more completing fellowship training to specialize in
              spine surgery.

              Psychiatry is the branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental,
              emotional
              and behavioral disorders. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor (an M.D. or D.O.) who specializes in mental
              health,
              including substance use disorders. Psychiatrists are qualified to assess both the mental and physical
              aspects of
              psychological problems.People seek psychiatric help for many reasons. The problems can be sudden, such as
              a panic
              attack, frightening hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, or hearing "voices." Or they may be more
              long-term, such
              as feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or anxiousness that never seem to lift or problems functioning,
              causing everyday
              life to feel distorted or out of control. Because they are physicians, psychiatrists can order or perform
              a full range of
              medical laboratory and psychological tests which, combined with discussions with patients, help provide a
              picture of a
              patient's physical and mental state.

              If you’ve ever had an illness or injury that impacted your ability to move or carry out daily
              tasks, your doctor may have referred you to a physiotherapist to get you back on your feet.
              A physiotherapist, or physical therapist, works with patients to help them manage pain, balance,
              mobility, and motor function. Most people at some point in their lifetime will work with a
              physiotherapist.
              You may have been referred to one after a car accident, after surgery, or to address low back pain.
              They work with patients with all types of conditions or limitations. A physiotherapist works with patients
              to develop customized programs designed to restore as much as possible their functional ability and
              movement.
              They take a holistic (whole-body) approach, addressing not only the physical aspects of your well-being,
              but also your emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
